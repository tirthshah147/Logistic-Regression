# Logistic-Regression from scratch with Python
Andrew Ng's course - logistic regression implementation in python. 

Logistic Regression is implemented in Python from scratch without using any third-party Python libraries. Forming proper dataset,Visualization,Gradient descent,calculating cost function,regularization and other algorithms are also implemented. 

So if you are doing Coursera's Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course and want to implement in Python then check this code.
